Welcome to jarsTiles source repo!

All of the core source files are stored in the src folder.

Make sure you read the Game Info and Specifications document
before staring your work! You need to check out the feature
that you are working on before committing changes, to prevent
merge conflicts.

Additional features may be added in the Feature Request text file.

To compile the code, you must have either:

Adobe Flex SDK (Free, will figure out the build script)
Flash CS5 Professional (work directly from the .fla)
Flash Builder 4 (create a new project, then copy over source files)
