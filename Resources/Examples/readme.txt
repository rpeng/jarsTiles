Instructions for Use
--------------------

To use any of these example projects in Flex Builder 2:

1) Select File > Import > Existing projects into workspace.
2) Select the root directory for the project you wish to import. 

Note that projects that load external files (.swf, .bmp, .xml) are compiled for network use and will cause a security error when tested locally outside of a trusted folder. Importing a project into Flex Builder 2 automatically grants trust to tha project's main directory. To grant trusts to a folder without importing it into Flex Builder, follow these steps:

1. Open the online Flash Player Settings Manager by browsing to the following web page: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
2. Under Global Security Settings>Always trust files in these locations, click Edit locations>Add location....
3. Enter or browse to the location you wish to trust.

For more information on Flash Player security limitations, see Chapter 19 of Essential ActionScript 3.0.
